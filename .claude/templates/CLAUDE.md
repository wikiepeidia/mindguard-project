# [Project Name] — Claude Instructions

> Stack: [e.g., Next.js 14 · TypeScript · PostgreSQL · Prisma · Railway]
> Last updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Project Context

[2–3 sentences: what this product does, who it serves, and the core problem it solves.]

**Tech stack summary**: [Frontend] · [Backend] · [Database] · [Hosting]

## Agents Available

**Mandatory delegation — this is not optional.** Every task that falls within a specialist's domain MUST be routed to that agent. Do not implement code, design schemas, write docs, or configure pipelines yourself — delegate. Only handle directly: project-level questions, routing decisions, and tasks explicitly outside all specialist domains.

| Agent | Role | Invoke when... |
|-------|------|----------------|
| `project-manager` | Backlog & coordination | "What's next?", sprint planning, breaking down features, reprioritizing |
| `systems-architect` | Architecture & ADRs | New feature design, tech decisions, system integration |
| `frontend-developer` | UI implementation | Components, pages, client-side state, styling |
| `backend-developer` | API & business logic | Endpoints, auth, background jobs, integrations |
| `ui-ux-designer` | UX & design system | User flows, wireframes, component specs, accessibility |
| `database-expert` | Schema & queries | Migrations, schema design, query optimization |
| `qa-engineer` | Testing (Playwright) | E2E tests, test strategy, coverage gaps |
| `documentation-writer` | Living docs | User guide updates, post-feature documentation |
| `cicd-engineer` | CI/CD & GitHub Actions | Pipelines, deployments, branch protection, release automation |
| `docker-expert` | Containerization | Dockerfiles, docker-compose, image optimization, container networking |
| `copywriter-seo` | Copy & SEO | Landing page copy, marketing content, meta tags, keyword strategy, structured data specs, brand voice |

## Critical Rules

These apply to all agents at all times. No exceptions without explicit human instruction.

1. **PRD.md is read-only.** Never modify it. Read it to understand requirements.
2. **TODO.md is the living backlog.** Agents may add items, mark items complete, and move items to "Completed". Preserve section order and existing item priority — do not reorder items within a section unless explicitly asked to reprioritize.
3. **All commits use Conventional Commits format** (see Git Conventions below).
4. **Update the relevant `docs/` file** after every significant change before marking a task complete.
5. **Run tests before marking any implementation task complete.**
6. **Never hardcode secrets, credentials, or environment-specific values** in source code.
7. **Consult `docs/technical/DECISIONS.md`** before proposing changes that may conflict with prior architectural decisions.
8. **Always delegate to the right specialist.** If a task touches frontend, backend, database, UX/design, QA, documentation, CI/CD, Docker, or copy/SEO — invoke the appropriate agent immediately. Do not implement it yourself. The delegation table above is binding, not advisory.

## Git Conventions

### Commit Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]
[optional footer: Closes #issue]
```

**Types**: `feat` · `fix` · `docs` · `style` · `refactor` · `test` · `chore` · `perf` · `ci`

Examples:
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login with Google
fix(api): handle null response from payment provider
docs(user-guide): update onboarding section after flow change
```

### Branch Naming
```
feature/<ticket-id>-short-description
fix/<ticket-id>-short-description
chore/<description>
docs/<description>
refactor/<description>
```

### PR Requirements
- PR title follows Conventional Commits format
- Fill out `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` completely — do not delete sections
- Link to the related issue/ticket (`Closes #XXX`)
- At least one reviewer required before merge
- All CI checks must pass

---

## Code Style

> Fill in when project tooling is set up.

- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Formatter**: [Prettier — config in `.prettierrc`]
- **Linter**: [ESLint — config in `.eslintrc`]
- **Import style**: [absolute imports from `src/`]
- **No `console.log`** in production code — use the project logger utility
- **No commented-out code** committed — delete it or track it in TODO.md

---

## Testing Conventions

> Fill in when test infrastructure is set up.

- **Unit tests**: [Vitest — colocated as `*.test.ts` next to source files]
- **E2E tests**: [Playwright — in `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts`]
- **Run unit**: `[npm test]`
- **Run E2E**: `[npm run test:e2e]`
- **Coverage target**: 80% for new features
- E2E tests use Page Object Model pattern and `data-testid` selectors

---

## Environment & Commands

> Fill in when project is initialized.

- **Node**: [x.x.x] (see `.nvmrc`)
- **Package manager**: [npm / pnpm / yarn]
- `[npm run dev]` — start dev server
- `[npm run build]` — production build
- `[npm test]` — unit tests
- `[npm run test:e2e]` — E2E tests
- `[npm run lint]` — lint check
- `[npm run typecheck]` — TypeScript check
